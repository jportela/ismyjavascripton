IsMyJavascriptOn.com repository

This webpage intends to reward those who have Javascript enabled. It first focuses on detecting if the browser has Javascript enabled, then provides those awesome people who have it by executing Javascript goodies.

It's still a WIP in very very early phases - just a couple of hours of work.

## ROADMAP

* Complete the interface of the Goodies Loader
* Add more modules for more interesting goodies
* Add jQuery and other useful libs
* Make this better! More comments, more high-quality code
